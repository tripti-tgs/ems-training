# Migrating from Express to Fastify: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Transitioning from Express.js to Fastify can significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of your Node.js web application. Fastify is known for its speed and low overhead, making it an excellent choice for building high-performance APIs. This guide will walk you through the migration process, explaining each step in detail.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the migration process, ensure you have:

- Basic knowledge of Express.js
- Understanding of JavaScript and Node.js concepts

## Step 1: Installation

First, install Fastify using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install fastify
npm install @fastify/cors
npm install @fastify/multipart
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

Replace your Express app initialization code with Fastify:

```javascript
// Before:
// const express = require("express");
// const app = express();

// After:
const app = require("fastify")();
```

Fastify also has a separate module for handling CORS. Instead of using middleware, you can register the `fastify-cors` plugin:

```javascript
// Before:
// const cors = require('cors');
// app.use(cors())

// After:
app.register(require("fastify-cors"));
```

## Step 3: Routes

Rewrite your routes using Fastify syntax. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Before:

// app.use('/user', userRoutes);
// app.use('/employee', employeeRoutes);
// app.use('/department', departmentRoutes);
// app.use('/salary', salaryRoutes);

// app.post("/register", userController.register);

// After:

app.register(userRoutes, { prefix: "/user" });
app.register(employeeRoutes, { prefix: "/employee" });
app.register(departmentRoutes, { prefix: "/department" });
app.register(salaryRoutes, { prefix: "/salary" });

app.post("/register", nameOfRouter.register);
```

## Step 4: Controllers

Fastify handles response differently from Express. Make sure to send responses appropriately in your controllers:

```javascript
// Before:
// res.status(201).json({ message: "User registered successfully!"});

// After:
res.status(201).send({message: "User registered successfully!"});
```

## Step 5: Error Handling

Fastify has its own way of handling errors. Ensure to update your code accordingly:

```javascript
// Before:
[
    body("name").notEmpty().withMessage("Name is required"),
    body("email").isEmail().withMessage("Invalid email"),
    body("phone").isInt().withMessage("Invalid phone number"),
    body("gender").isInt().withMessage("Invalid gender"),
    body("dob").isDate().withMessage("Invalid date of birth"),
    body("dept_name").notEmpty().withMessage("Invalid department Name"),
],

// After:

schema: {
    consumes: ['multipart/form-data'],
    body: {
        type: "object",
        required: ["name", "email", "phone", "gender", "dob", "dept_id"],
        properties: {
            name: { type: "string" },
            email: { type: "string", format: "email" },
            phone: { type: "integer" },
            gender: { type: "integer" },
            dob: { type: "string", format: "date" },
            dept_id: { type: "string" },
        },
    },
},
```

## Step 6: Middleware

Fastify uses hooks for middleware. Update your middleware registration accordingly:

```javascript
// Before:
// router.use(authMiddleware);

// After:
fastify.addHook("preHandler", authMiddleware);
```

## Explanation

### Why Fastify?

Fastify is chosen for its superior performance and low overhead compared to Express.js. It's built with a focus on speed, making it an excellent choice for high-performance applications, particularly APIs and microservices. By migrating to Fastify, you can improve your application's response time and scalability.

### How Things Change

1. **Routing**: Fastify's routing mechanism is similar to Express, but it offers additional features like route prefixes, which can help in organizing your application's endpoints more efficiently.

2. **Middleware**: Fastify uses hooks for middleware instead of the traditional middleware stack used in Express. This change allows for more granular control over request processing and can improve overall performance.

3. **Error Handling**: Fastify handles errors differently from Express, so it's essential to update error handling code to align with Fastify's error handling mechanism.

4. **Controllers**: Fastify requires a slight adjustment in how responses are sent from controllers. Instead of using `res.json()` or `res.send()`, you'll use `res.send()` exclusively.

5. **Plugins**: Fastify provides a robust plugin ecosystem, allowing you to easily extend its functionality. In this guide, we've used the `fastify-cors` plugin as an example of how to integrate additional functionality into your Fastify application.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly migrate your Express.js application to Fastify, unlocking its full potential for speed and performance.
